## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| In-game stat tracking (K/D, hours) | Breeds toxicity; breaks with Arma updates; attendance is the metric that matters |
| Forum / discussion board | Discord already handles all unit communication |
| Real-time chat on website | Duplicates Discord with zero benefit |
| Public leaderboards | Conflicts with military culture model; awards system handles recognition |
| Mod repository / file hosting | Steam Workshop handles this; storage costs not justified |
| Integrated VOIP | Discord/TeamSpeak/ACRE2 already in use |
| Finance / dues tracking | Unit is free; adding money creates unnecessary complexity |
| Automated disciplinary tribunal | Over-engineering for 10-30 person unit; admin notes suffice |
| Mobile app | Web-first with responsive design covers mobile |
| Multi-squadron support | Building for Squadron A only |
