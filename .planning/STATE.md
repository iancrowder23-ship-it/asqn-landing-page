# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** A soldier's complete service record — from enlistment to current status — is accurate, accessible, and drives unit management decisions.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing — plan 01-02 complete, plan 01-03 next
Last activity: 2026-02-12 — Plan 01-02 (Discord OAuth auth) complete

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 8%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 2.5 min
- Total execution time: 5 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2/4 | 5 min | 2.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3 min, 2 min
- Trend: -

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 (runes), Supabase, Tailwind v4, sveltekit-superforms + Zod v4, adapter-node
- Schema: Service records are append-only event logs from day one — this is irreversible once data exists
- Auth: Discord OAuth only via Supabase — Custom Access Token Hook injects role into JWT for RLS
- Security: RLS must be enabled on every table at creation time; no exceptions
- Tailwind v4 CSS-first: @import "tailwindcss" in app.css only, no tailwind.config.ts, no PostCSS
- adapter-node explicit: Changed from adapter-auto default — unambiguous Docker/VPS deployment target
- Docker two-stage build: builder/runner pattern with node:22-alpine keeps production image small
- NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX workaround: NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=/nonexistent in shell env — all npm/npx commands require env -u NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX prefix
- getClaims() pattern: auth.getClaims() used directly — available in @supabase/supabase-js v2.95.3, no manual JWT decode needed
- Cookie path '/': enforced in setAll handler in createSupabaseServerClient — required for cross-route persistence
- createSupabaseServerClient uses `any` generic temporarily — plan 01-03 will replace with typed Database

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (Enlistment State Machine): DB-level transition enforcement approach (trigger vs. check constraint vs. RPC) needs a concrete decision during planning — research flag from SUMMARY.md
- Phase 5 (Promotion Workflow): Admin notification strategy (Supabase Realtime vs. polling vs. webhooks) needs a decision during planning
- **All subsequent plans**: `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=/nonexistent` is set in shell environment — all npm/npx commands must use `env -u NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` prefix

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-12
Stopped at: Plan 01-02 complete — Discord OAuth auth with getClaims(), session cookies, and /(app) route guard
Resume file: None
Next action: Execute plan 01-03 (database schema + typed database.ts generation)
