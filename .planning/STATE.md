# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 (runes), Supabase, Tailwind v4, sveltekit-superforms + Zod v4, adapter-node
- Schema: Service records are append-only event logs from day one — this is irreversible once data exists
- Auth: Discord OAuth only via Supabase — Custom Access Token Hook injects role into JWT for RLS
- Security: RLS must be enabled on every table at creation time; no exceptions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (Enlistment State Machine): DB-level transition enforcement approach (trigger vs. check constraint vs. RPC) needs a concrete decision during planning — research flag from SUMMARY.md
- Phase 5 (Promotion Workflow): Admin notification strategy (Supabase Realtime vs. polling vs. webhooks) needs a decision during planning
