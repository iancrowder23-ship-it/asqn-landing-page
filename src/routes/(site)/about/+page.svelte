      <p>
        ASQN 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment is an Arma 3 milsim unit modeled after
        real-world US Army Special Forces. Our unit operates as a squadron-level element,
        conducting a wide range of special operations missions in the Arma 3 environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded by veterans of the Arma milsim community, 1st SFOD was established to provide
        a structured, realistic military simulation experience. We draw inspiration from the
        operational methodologies and organizational structure of US Army Special Forces (Delta Force / 1st SFOD-D)
        while adapting them for the Arma 3 platform.

        Our members can expect a disciplined but welcoming environment where teamwork,
        tactical proficiency, and camaraderie are the pillars of our community.
